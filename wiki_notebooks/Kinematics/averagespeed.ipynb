    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Average speed is a scalar quantity that represents the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. It measures how fast an object is moving without considering the direction of motion.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Formula**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Average Speed} = \\frac{\\text{Total Distance}}{\\text{Total Time}}\n",

    "1. **Scalar Quantity:**  \n",
    "   Average speed only considers magnitude, not direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Always Positive:**  \n",
    "   Since distance is always positive, average speed is also always positive.\n",

    "   - Always positive.\n",
    "   - Scalar quantity (no direction).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Average Velocity:**\n",
    "   - Measures the total displacement divided by total time.\n",
