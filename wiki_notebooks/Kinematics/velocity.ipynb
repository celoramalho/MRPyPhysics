    "## What is Average Velocity?\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Velocity is a measure of how quickly an object changes its position over a given period of time. It is calculated by dividing the **displacement** (change in position) by the **time interval** during which the displacement occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for average Velocity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $v_{\\text{avg}}$ = Average Velocity (measured in meters per second, $m/s$).\n",
    "- $\\Delta s$ = Displacement (the change in position, measured in meters, $m$).\n",
    "- $\\Delta t$ = Time interval (measured in seconds, \\(s\\)).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displacement Δs:\n",
    "Displacement is the shortest displacement between the initial and final positions of an object, considering the direction. It is a **vector quantity**, meaning it has both magnitude and direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Interval Δt:\n",
    "The time interval is the amount of time taken for the displacement to occur. It is a **scalar quantity**, meaning it only has magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Average Velocity $v_{\\text{avg}}$:\n",
    "Average Velocity considers the direction of motion and is a **vector quantity**. If the object moves in a straight line without changing direction, the magnitude of the average Velocity is the same as the average Velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A car travels from Point A to Point B, a displacement of 100 meters, in 10 seconds. The average Velocity is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\Delta s}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{100}{10} = 10 \\, m/s\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the car's average Velocity is $10 $, $m/s$ in the direction of displacement.\n",
